### Notes
One Challenge I faced was that: The code would run and it would say "succesfully built", but I wasn't able to go to the superheroes page in the app. This took a lot of time. But I was able to solve the problem with the help of an ios- TA.
I also had a very hard time pushing it to GitHub and wasn't able to push it to the Old Repository, so i created a new one.
